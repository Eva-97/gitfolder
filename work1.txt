In the metropolitan city of Lagos,there lived a family of five; a father, a mother and three sons.
Joyously, they expected another child and prayed it to be a girl. Fortunately, they had another son and brother; ME :) 
I grew up to be an obedient and beautiful child (as my looks were like that of a lady). People were awed at a glance of me that some offer lifts to my parents just to spend more time with me. 
At 16 years of age, I had completed primary 4 and preparing for my first common entrance. I had faded a little in my beauty as I developed more masculine features, though, it was up to expectations I believed. The family of six grew in age, maturity and togetherness. 

We weren't rich nor poor, but we had enough to take care of our basic needs. At 24 years of age, I had completed my tertiary institution and mandatory service year with a job to take care of body and soul. 

At 18 years, I had entered the university.
It took me t years to complete my degree and a year for service.
2020 came with the shock of the pandemic which reduced a significant period my plans to get a job. 

ans to get a job.
