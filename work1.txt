In the metropolitan city of Lagos,there lived a family of five; a father, a mother and three sons.
Joyously, they expected another child and prayed it to be a girl. Fortunately, they had another son and brother; ME :) 
I grew up to be an obedient and beautiful child (as my looks were like that of a lady). People were awed at a glance of me that some offer lifts to my parents just to spend more time with me. 
At 16 years of age, I had completed primary 4 and preparing for my first common entrance. I had faded a little in my beauty as I developed more masculine features, though, it was up to expectations I believed. The family of six grew in age, maturity and togetherness.
