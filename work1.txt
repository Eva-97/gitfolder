In the meteopolitan city of Lagos,there lived a family of five:a father,a mother and three sons.
Joyously, they expected another child and prayed it to be a girl. Fortunately, they had another son and brother; ME :) 
I grew up to be an obedient and beautiful child (as my looks were like that of a lady). People were awed at a glance of me that some offer lifts to my parents just to spend more time with me.
